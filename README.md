# Portfolio project

Little portfolio project from Udacity Fromt-end nanodegree.

## How do I complete this project?

For completing this project I store my resume data in javaScript objects, while all of the HTML code needed to build the resume is stored in **js/helper.js** variables. The variable names indicate their function. I replace substrings in these variable string values such as **%data%** and **#** with the data in my javaScript objects, and append or prepend the formatted result to resume in the appropriate location.
